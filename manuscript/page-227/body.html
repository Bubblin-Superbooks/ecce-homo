I refer to their laxity in matters historical. Not only have the Germans entirely lost the <em>breadth of vision</em> which enables one to grasp the course of culture and the values of culture; not only are they one and all political (or Church) puppets; but they have also actually <em>put a ban upon</em> this very breadth of vision. A man must first and foremost be "German," he must belong to "<em>the</em> race"; then only can he pass judgment upon all values and lack of values in historyâ€”then only can he establish them.... To be German is in itself an argument, "Germany, Germany above all," is a principle; the Germans  stand for the "moral order of the universe" in history; compared with the Roman Empire, they are the up-holders of freedom; compared with the eighteenth century, they are the restorers of morality, of the "Categorical Imperative."</p></div> </div>
