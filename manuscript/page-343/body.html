Earn fame. For virtue is fame's clever bawd.

Amongst these virtuous, I prefer to be  
One guilty of all vile and horrid sin!  
And when I see fame's importunity  
So advertise her shameless harlotry,  
Ambition turns to gall. Amidst such kin  
One place alone, the lowest, would I win.

This fame, which all the wide world loves,  
I touch with gloves,  
And scorning beat  
Beneath my feet.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
