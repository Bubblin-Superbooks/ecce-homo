<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">In thine own shaft  
Bowed as thou workest,  
In thine own cavern  
Digging at thyself,  
Helpless quite,  
Stiff,  
A cold corse  
Overwhelmed with a hundred burdens,  
Overburdened by thyself,  
A knower!  
A self-knower!  
The wise Zarathustra!...  

Thou soughtest the heaviest burden,  
So foundest thou thyself,  
And canst not shake thyself off....  

Watching,
