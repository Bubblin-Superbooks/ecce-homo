Trust a Genoese again.  
At the blue he gazes ever,  
Distance doth his soul enchain.  

Strangeness is to me too dear—  
Genoa has sunk and passed—  
Heart, be cool! Hand, firmly steer!  
Sea before me: land—at last?  

Firmly let us plant our feet,  
Ne'er can we give up this game—  
From the distance what doth greet?  
One death, one happiness, one fame.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
