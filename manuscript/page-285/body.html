<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Rather hops and stings like flea:  
"Woman seldom harbours thought;  
If she thinks, no good is she!"  

To this wisdom, old, renowned,  
Bow I in deep reverence:  
Now my wisdom I'll expound  
In its very quintessence.  

A voice spoke in me yesterday  
As ever—listen if you can:  
"Woman is more beauteous aye,  
But more interesting—man!"  

"PIA, CARITATEVOLE, AMOROSISSIMA"  

Cave where the dead ones rest,  
O marble falsehood, thee  
</pre></div> </div>
