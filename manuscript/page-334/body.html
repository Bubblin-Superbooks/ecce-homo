Around but waves and play.  
Whatever was hard  
——Sank into blue oblivion.  
My boat now stands idle.  
Storm and motion—how did it forget them!  
Desire and Hope are drowned,  
Sea and soul are becalmed.  

Seventh Solitude!  
Never felt!  
Sweet certainty nearer,  
Or warmer the sun's ray.  
——Glows not the ice of my summit yet?  
Silvery, light, a fish  
Now my vessel swims out....</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
