<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Tree In Autumn</h4><pre class="  ">Why did ye, blockheads, me awaken  
While I in blissful blindness stood?  
Ne'er I by fear more fell was shaken—  
Vanished my golden dreaming mood.  

Bear-elephants, with trunks all greedy,  
Knock first! Where have your manners fled?  
I threw—and fear has made me speedy—  
Dishes of ripe fruit—at your head.  

AMONG FOES (OR AGAINST CRITICS)  

(_After a Gipsy Proverb_)  

Here the gallows, there the cord,  
And the hangman's ruddy beard.
