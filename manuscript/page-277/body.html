<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Autumn</h4><pre class="  ">'Tis Autumn:—Autumn yet shall break thy heart!  
Fly away! fly away!—  
The sun creeps 'gainst the hill  
And climbs and climbs  
And rests at every step.  

How faded grew the world!  
On weary, slackened strings the wind  
Playeth his tune.  
Fair Hope fled far—  
He waileth after.  

'Tis Autumn:—Autumn yet shall break thy heart!  
Fly away! fly away!  
O fruit of the tree,  
Thou tremblest, fallest?
