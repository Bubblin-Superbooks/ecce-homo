<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Campo Santo DI Staglieno</h4><pre class="  ">Maiden, in gentle wise  
You stroke your lamb's soft fleece,  
Yet flashing from your eyes  
Both light and flame ne'er cease.  
Creature of merry jest  
And favourite near and far,  
Pious with kindness blest,  
Amorosissima!  

What broke so soon the chain,  
What does your heart deplore?  
And who, pray, would not fain,  
If you loved him, adore?â€”  
You're mute, but from your eye,  
The tear-drop is not far,  
You're mute: you'll yearn and die,  
</pre></div> </div>
