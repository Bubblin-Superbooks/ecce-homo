<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>To Richard Wagner</h4><pre class="  ">O You who chafe at every fetter's link,  
A restless spirit, never free:  
Who, though victorious aye, in bonds still cowered,  
Disgusted more and more, and flayed and scoured,  
Till from each cup of balm you poison drink,  
Alas! and by the Cross all helpless sink,  
You too, you too, among the overpowered!  

For long I watched this play so weirdly shaped,  
Breathing an air of prison, vault, and dread,  
With churchly fragrance, clouds of incense spread,  
And yet I found all strange/in terror gaped.  
But now I throw my fool's cap o'er my head,  
For I escaped!</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
