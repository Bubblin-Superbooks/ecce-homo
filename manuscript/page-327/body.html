<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Uncertain,  
Weary at every wound,  
Shivering at every frost,  
Throttled in thine own noose,  
Self-knower!  
Self-hangman!  

Why didst bind thyself  
With the noose of thy wisdom?  
Why luredst thyself  
Into the old serpent's paradise?  
Why stolest into  
Thyself, thyself?...  

A sick man now,  
Sick of serpent's poison,  
A captive now  
Who hast drawn the hardest lot:
