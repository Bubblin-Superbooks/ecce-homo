<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>To The Glacier</h4><pre class="  ">At noontide hour, when first,  
Into the mountains Summer treads,  
Summer, the boy with eyes so hot and weary,  
Then too he speaks,  
Yet we can only see his speech.  

His breath is panting, like the sick man's breath  
On fevered couch.  
The glacier and the fir tree and the spring  
Answer his call  
——Yet we their answer only see.  
For faster from the rock leaps down  
The torrent stream, as though to greet,  
And stands, like a white column trembling,  
All yearning there.  
And darker yet and truer looks the fir-tree  
</pre></div> </div>
