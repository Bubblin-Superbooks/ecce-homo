Lonely!  
Who would venture  
Here to be guest—  
To be thy guest?  

A bird of prey, perchance  
Joyous at others' misfortune,  
Will cling persistent  
To the hair of the steadfast watcher,  
With frenzied laughter,  
A vulture's laughter....  

Wherefore so steadfast?  
——Mocks he so cruel:  
He must have wings, who loves the abyss,  
He must not stay on the cliff,
