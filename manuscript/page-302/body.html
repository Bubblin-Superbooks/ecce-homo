<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Joyful Wisdom</h4><pre class="  ">This is no book—for such, who looks?  
Coffins and shrouds, naught else, are books!  
What's dead and gone they make their prey,  
Yet in my book lives fresh To-day.  

This is no book—for such, who looks?  
Who cares for coffins, shrouds, and spooks?  
This is a promise, an act of will,  
A last bridge-breaking, for good or ill;  
A wind from sea, an anchor light,  
A whirr of wheels, a steering right.  
The cannon roars, white smokes its flame,  
The sea—the monster—laughs and scents its game.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
