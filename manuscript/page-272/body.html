"I lure not thee,—no, thou art wrong—  
With these my trills  
I lure my mate from off the hills—  
Nor heed thy plight.  
To me alone the night's not fair.  
What's that to thee? Forth must thou fare,  
On, onward ever, resting ne'er.  

Why stand'st thou now?  
What has my piping done to thee,  
Thou roaming wight?"  
The good bird pondered, silent quite,  
"Why doth my piping change his plight?  
Why stands he now,  
That luckless, luckless, roaming wight?"</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
