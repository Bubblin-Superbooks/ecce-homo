<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Music Of The South</h4><pre class="  ">All that my eagle e'er saw clear,  
I see and feel in heart to-day  
(Although my hope was wan and gray)  
Thy song like arrow pierced mine ear,  
A balm to touch, a balm to hear,  
As down from heaven it winged its way.  

So now for lands of southern fire  
To happy isles where Grecian nymphs hold sport!  
Thither now turn the ship's desireâ€”  
No ship e'er sped to fairer port.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
