Wisdom reached I, a maiden fair,  
I am grey-haired, it appears,  
Now in all things—save my hair.  

Yesterday, I had a thought,  
Was't a thought?—you laugh and scorn!  
Did you ever have a thought?  
Rather was a feeling born.  

Dare a woman think? This screed  
Wisdom long ago begot:  
"Follow woman must, not lead;  
If she thinks, she follows not."  

Wisdom speaks—I credit naught:
