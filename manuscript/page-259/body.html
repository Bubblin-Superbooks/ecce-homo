The allurement of that  which is detrimental, the inability to discover one's own advantage and self-destruction, are made into absolute qualities, into the "duty," the "holiness," and the "divinity" of man. Finally—to keep the worst to the last—by the notion of the <em>good</em> man, all that is favoured which is weak, ill, botched, and sick-in-itself, which <em>ought to be wiped out.</em> The law of selection is thwarted, an ideal is made out of opposition to the proud, well-constituted man, to him who says yea to life, to him who is certain of the future, and who guarantees the future—this man is henceforth called the <em>evil</em> one.
