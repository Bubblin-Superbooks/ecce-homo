THE LITTLE BRIG NAMED "LITTLE ANGEL"  

"Little Angel" call they me!â€”  
Now a ship, but once a girl,  
Ah, and still too much a girl!  
My steering-wheel, so bright to see,  
But for sake of love doth whirl.  

"Little Angel" call they me,  
With hundred flags to ornament,  
A captain smart, on glory bent,  
Steers me, puffed with vanity  
(He himself's an ornament).  

"Little Angel" call they me,  
And where'er a little flame  
</pre></div> </div>
