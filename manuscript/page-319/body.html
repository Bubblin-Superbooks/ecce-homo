<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Ye cows of the heights!  
Milk-warm wisdom, sweet dew of love  
I pour over the land.  

Away, away, ye truths  
That look so gloomy!  
I will not have on my mountains  
Bitter, impatient truths.  
May truth approach me to-day  
Gilded by smiles,  
Sweetened by the sun, browned by love,â€”  
A ripe truth I would fain break off from the tree.  

To-day I stretch my hands  
Toward the tresses of chance,  
Wise enough to lead,  
To outwit chance like a child.  
To-day I will be hospitable
