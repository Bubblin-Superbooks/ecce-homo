<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Why flew Zarathustra from beasts and men?  
Why fled he swift from all continents?  
Six solitudes he knows already—  
But even the sea was not lonely enough for him,  
On the island he could climb, on the mount he  
became flame,  
At the seventh solitude  
He casts a fishing-rod far o'er his head.  

Storm-tossed seamen! Wreckage of ancient stars  
Ye seas of the future! Uncompassed heavens!  
At all lonely ones I now throw my fishing-rod.  
Give answer to the flame's impatience,  
Let me, the fisher on high mountains,  
Catch my seventh, last solitude!——</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
