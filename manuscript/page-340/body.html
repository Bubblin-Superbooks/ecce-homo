See, suddenly flames forth a lightning-flash,  
The pit profound with thunderous challenge fights  
Against the heavens, midst clamorous crack and crash  
Of the great mountain! Cradled in the heights,  
Born as the fruit of hate and lightning's love,  
The wrath of Zarathustra dwells above  
And looms with menace of a thundercloud.  

---

Ye, who have roofs, go quickly, creep and hide!  
To bed, ye tenderlings! For thunders loud  
Upon the blasts of storm triumphant ride,  
And bastions and ramparts sway and rock,  

The lightning sears the dusky face of night,
