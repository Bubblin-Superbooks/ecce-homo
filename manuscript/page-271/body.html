<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>The Wanderer</h4><pre class="  ">All through the night a wanderer walks  
Sturdy of stride,  
With winding vale and sloping height  
E'er at his side.  
Fair is the night:  
On, on he strides, nor slackens speed,  
And knows not where his path will lead.  

A bird's song in the night is heard,  
"Ah me, what hast thou done, O bird,  
How dost thou grip my sense and feet  
And pourest heart-vexation sweet  
Into mine earâ€”I must remain,  
To hearken fain:  
Why lure me with inviting strain?"
