<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Like gleaming ray  
Over the mountain;  
All round they ponder,—  
Nor speak—  

Twas at the noon,  
At noontide hour, when first  
Into the mountains Summer treads,  
Summer, the boy with eyes so hot and weary.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
