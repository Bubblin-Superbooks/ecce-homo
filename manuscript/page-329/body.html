<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Chewing,  
One that stands upright no more!  
Thou wilt grow deformed even in thy grave,  
Deformed spirit!  

And of late still so proud  
On all the stilts of thy pride!  
Of late still the godless hermit,  
The hermit with one comrade—the devil,  
The scarlet prince of every devilment!...  

Now—  
Between two nothings  
Huddled up,  
A question-mark,  
A weary riddle,  
A riddle for vultures....  
They will "solve" thee,  
</pre></div> </div>
