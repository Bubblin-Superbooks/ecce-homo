<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>In Lonesomeness</h4><pre class="  ">The cawing crows  
Townwards on whirring pinions roam;  
Soon come the snows—  
Thrice happy now who hath a home!  

Fast-rooted there,  
Thou gazest backwards—oh, how long!  
Thou fool, why dare  
Ere winter come, this world of wrong?  

This world—a gate  
To myriad deserts dumb and hoar!  
Who lost through fate  
What thou hast lost, shall rest no more.  

Now stand'st thou pale,  
</pre></div> </div>
