<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Ah, child, you know we love you, love you true!  

And he,  
Summer, the boy with eyes so hot and weary,  
Woe-worn, gives kisses  
More ardent ever,  
And will not go:  
But like to veils he blows his words  
From out his lips,  
His cruel words:  
"My greeting's parting,  
My coming going,  
In youth I die."  

All round they hearken  
And scarcely breathe  
(No songster sings),  
And shuddering run  
</pre></div> </div>
