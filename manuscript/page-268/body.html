<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Of thine armoured steps, heard weapons slam,  
Heard thy brazen chain strike 'gainst the sashes,  
And thy voice: "Come! hearken who I am!  

The immortal Amazon they call me;  
All things weak and womanish I shun;  
Manly scorn and hate in war enthral me;  
Victress I and tigress all in one!  

Where I tread there corpses fall before me;  
From mine eyes the furious torches fly,  
And my brain thinks poisons. Bend, adore me!  
Worm of Earth and Will o' Wispâ€”or die!"</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
