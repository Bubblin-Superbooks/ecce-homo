<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">That hath swallowed gold:  
They will slit up thy belly yet!  

Thou art too rich,  
Thou corrupter of many!  
Thou makest too many jealous,  
Too many poor....  
Even on me thy light casts a shadowâ€”  
I feel chill: go away, thou rich one  
Go away, Zarathustra, from the path of thy sun</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
