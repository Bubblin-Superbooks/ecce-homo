<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Friend Yorick</h4><pre class="  ">Be of good cheer,  
Friend Yorick! If this thought gives pain,  
As now it does, I fear,  
Is it not "God"? And though in error lain,  
'Tis but your own dear child,  
Your flesh and blood,  
That tortures you and gives you pain,  
Your little rogue and do-no-good,  
See if the rod will change its mood!  

In brief, friend Yorick, leave that drear  
Philosophy—and let me now  
Whisper one word as medicine,  
My own prescription, in your ear,  
My remedy against such spleen—  
"Who loves his God, chastises him, I ween,"</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
