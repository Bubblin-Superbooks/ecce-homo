<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>To Friendship</h4><pre class="  ">Hail to thee, Friendship!  
My hope consummate,  
My first red daybreak!  
Alas, so endless  
Oft path and night seemed,  
And life's long road  
Aimless and hateful!  
Now life I'd double  
In thine eyes seeing  
Dawn-glory, triumph,  
Most gracious goddess!</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
