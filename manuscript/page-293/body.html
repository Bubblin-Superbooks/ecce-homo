<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">A frozen pilgrimage thy doom,  
Like smoke whose trail  
Cold and still colder skies consume.  

Fly, bird, and screech,  
Like desert-fowl, thy song apart!  
Hide out of reach,  
Fool! in grim ice thy bleeding heart.  

Firmly let us plant our feet,  
Ne'er can we give up this game—  
From the distance what doth greet?  
One death, one happiness, one fame.  

The cawing crows  
Townwards on whirring pinions roam:  
Soon come the snows—  
Woe unto him who hath no home!
