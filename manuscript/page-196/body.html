<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">a good deal—I was perfectly robust and patient.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">With the exception of these periods of industry lasting ten days, the years I spent during the production of <em>Zarathustra,</em> and thereafter, were for me years of unparalleled distress. A man pays dearly for being immortal: to this end he must die many times over during his life. There is such a thing as what I call the rancour of greatness: everything great, whether a work or a deed, once it is completed, turns immediately against its author. The very fact that he is its author makes him weak at this time. He can no longer endure his deed. He can no longer look it full in the face. To have something at one's back which one could never have willed, something to which the knot of human destiny is attached—and to be forced thenceforward to bear it on one's shoulders! Why, it almost crushes one! The rancour of greatness! A somewhat different experience is the uncanny silence that reigns about one.</p></div> </div>
