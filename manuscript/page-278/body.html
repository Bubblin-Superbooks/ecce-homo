<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">What secret whispered unto thee  
The Night,  
That icy shudders deck thy cheek,  
Thy cheek of purple hue?  

Silent art thou, nor dost reply—  
Who speaketh still?—  

'Tis Autumn:—Autumn yet shall break thy heart!  
Fly away! fly away!—  
"I am not fair,"—  
So speaks the lone star-flower,—  
"Yet men I love  
And comfort men—  
Many flowers shall they behold,  
And stoop to me,  
And break me, ah!—  
So that within their eyes shall gleam  
</pre></div> </div>
