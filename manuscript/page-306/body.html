The mouse that gave a mountain birth  
Is you yourself confessed!  
You're all and naught, you're inn and wine,  
You're phœnix, mountain, mouse.  
Back to yourself to come you pine  
Or fly from out your house.  
Downward from every height you've sunk,  
And in the depths still shine:  
The drunkenness of all the drunk,  
Why do you ask for—wine?</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
