<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">From the cliff and broke a rib:  
From my frame my soul went free,  
Yes, escaped me through that rib.  

"Little Angel" call they me—  
Then my soul, like cat in flight  
Straight did on this ship alight  
Swiftly bounding—one, two, three!  
Yes, its claws are swift to smite.  

"Little Angel" call they me!—  
Now a ship, but once a girl,  
Ah, and still too much a girl!  
My steering-wheel, so bright to see,  
For sake of love alone doth whirl.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
