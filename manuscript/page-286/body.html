<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">I love: for easy jest  
My soul thou settest free.  

To-day, to-day alone,  
My soul to tears is stirred,  
At thee, the pictured stone,  
At thee, the graven word.  

This picture (none need wis)  
I kissed the other day.  
When there's so much to kiss  
Why did I kiss the—clay?  

Who knows the reason why?  
"A tombstone fool!" you laugh:  
I kissed—I'll not deny—  
E'en the long epitaph.</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
