<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>The Last Desire</h4><pre class="  ">So would I die  
As then I saw him die,  
The friend, who like a god  
Into my darkling youth  
Threw lightning's light and fire:  
Buoyant yet deep was he,  
Yea, in the battle's strife  
With the gay dancer's heart.  

Amid the warriors  
His was the lightest heart,  
Amid the conquerors  
His brow was dark with thoughtâ€”  
He was a fate poised on his destiny:  
Unbending, casting thought into the past  
And future, such was he.
