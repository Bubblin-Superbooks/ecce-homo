<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Than e'er before.  
And 'twixt the ice-mass and the cold grey stone  
A sudden light breaks forth—  
Such light I once beheld, and marked the sign.  

Even the dead man's eye  
Surely once more grows light,  
When, sorrowful, his child  
Gives him embrace and kiss:  
Surely once more the flame of light  
Wells out, and glowing into life  
The dead eye speaks: "My child!  
Ah child, you know I love you true!"  

So all things glow and speak—the glacier speaks,  
The brook, the fir,  
Speak with their glance the selfsame words:  
We love you true,
