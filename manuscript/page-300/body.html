<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">All stark, all formless, and all cold,  
Its little body changed and battered,  
By death and dying rudely shattered.  

A dead word is a hateful thing,  
A barren, rattling, ting-ting-ting.  
A curse on ugly trades I cry  
That doom all little words to die!</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
