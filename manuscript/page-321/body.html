<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Me, the monster of light—  
Me, Zarathustra, the squanderer of all wisdom?  

Sick to-day from tenderness,  
A dewy wind,  
Zarathustra sits waiting, waiting on his mountains—  
Sweet and stewing  
In his own juice,  
Beneath his own summit,  
Beneath his ice,  
Weary and happy,  
A Creator on his seventh day.  

——Silence!  
A truth passes over me  
Like a cloud,—  
With invisible lightnings it strikes me,  
On broad, slow stairs,  
</pre></div> </div>
