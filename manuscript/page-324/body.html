<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Between Birds Of Prey</h4><pre class="  ">Who would here descend,  
How soon  
Is he swallowed up by the depths!  
But thou, Zarathustra,  
Still lovest the abysses,  
Lovest them as doth the fir tree!  

The fir flings its roots  
Where the rock itself gazes  
Shuddering at the depths,â€”  
The fir pauses before the abysses  
Where all around  
Would fain descend:  
Amid the impatience  
Of wild, rolling, leaping torrents  
It waits so patient, stern and silent,  
</pre></div> </div>
