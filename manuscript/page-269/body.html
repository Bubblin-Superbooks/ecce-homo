Goddess Friendship, deign to hear the song  
That we sing in friendship's honour!  
Where the eye of friendship glances,  
Filled with all the joy of friendship  
Come thou nigh to aid me,  
Rosy dawn in thy gaze and  
In holy hand the faithful pledge of youth eternal.  

---

Morning's past: the sun of noonday  
Scorches with hot ray our heads.  
Let us sit beneath the arbour  
Singing songs in praise of friendship.
