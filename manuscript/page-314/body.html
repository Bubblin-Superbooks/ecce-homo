<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Resolution</h4><pre class="  ">I should be wise to suit my mood,  
Not at the beck of other men:  
God made as stupid as he could  
The world—well, let me praise him then.  

And if I make not straight my track,  
But, far as may be, wind and bend,  
That's how the sage begins his tack,  
And that is how the fool will—end.

The world stands never still,  
Night loves the glowing day—  
Sweet sounds to ear "I will!"  
And sweeter still "I may!"</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
