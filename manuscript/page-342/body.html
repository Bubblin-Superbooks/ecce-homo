Whose ringing chink wins all the world's acclaim.

Hast thou the lust to buy? It needs no skill.  
They are all venal. Let thy purse be deep,  
And let their greedy paws unhindered creep  
Into its depths. So let them take their fill,  
For if thou dost not offer them enough,  
Their "virtue" they'll parade, to hide their huff.  

---

They are all virtuous, yea every one.  
Virtue and fame are ever in accord  
So long as time doth run,
