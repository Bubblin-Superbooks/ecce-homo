For _that_ they sank the deeper so they might  
Within themselves light Destiny's abysses.  

Thus oft in sullenness perverse and free,  
Bent hideous like a savage at his altar,  
There, Melancholy, held I thought of thee,  
A penitent, though youthful, with his psalter.  

So crouched did I enjoy the vulture's span,  
The thunder of the avalanche's paces,  
Thou spakest to meâ€”nor wast false like man,  
Thou spakest, but with stern and dreadful faces.  

Harsh goddess thou of Nature wild and stark,  
Mistress, that com'st with threats to daunt and quell me,  
To point me out the vulture's airy are
