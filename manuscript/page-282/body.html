<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Gleams for me, I, like a lamb,  
Go my journey eagerly  
(I was always such a lamb!).  

"Little Angel" call they me—  
Think you I can bark and whine  
Like a dog, this mouth of mine  
Throwing smoke and flame full free?  
Ah, a devil's mouth is mine.  

"Little Angel" call they me—  
Once I spoke a bitter word,  
That my lover, when he heard,  
Fast and far away did flee:  
Yes, I killed him with that word!  

"Little Angel" call they me:  
Hardly heard, I sprang so glib
