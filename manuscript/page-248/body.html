To desire everybody to become a "good man," "a gregarious animal," "a blue-eyed, benevolent, beautiful soul," or—as Herbert Spencer wished—a creature of altruism, would mean robbing existence of its greatest character, castrating man, and reducing humanity to a sort of wretched Chinadom. <em>And this some have tried to do! It is precisely this that men called morality.</em> In this sense Zarathustra calls "the good," now "the last men," and anon "the beginning of the end"; and above all, he considers them as <em>the most detrimental kind of men,</em> because they secure their existence at the cost of Truth and at the cost of the Future.</p></div> </div>
