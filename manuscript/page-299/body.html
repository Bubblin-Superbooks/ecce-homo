<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>The Word</h4><pre class="  ">I dearly love the living word,  
That flies to you like a merry bird,  
Ready with pleasant nod to greet,  
E'en in misfortune welcome, sweet,  
Yet it has blood, can pant you deep:  
Then to the dove's ear it will creep:  
And curl itself, or start for flightâ€”  
Whate'er it does, it brings delight.  

Yet tender doth the word remain,  
Soon it is ill, soon well again:  
So if its little life you'd spare,  
O grasp it lightly and with care,  
Nor heavy hand upon it lay,  
For e'en a cruel glance would slay!  
There it would lie, unsouled, poor thing!
