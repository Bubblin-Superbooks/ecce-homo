<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">Round, the venom-glancing horde:—  
Nothing new to me's appeared.  
Many times I've seen the sight,  
Now laughing in your face I cry,  
"Hanging me is useless quite:  
Die? Nay, nay, I cannot die!"  

Beggars all! Ye envy me  
Winning what ye never won!  
True, I suffer agony,  
But for you—your life is done.  
Many times I've faced death's plight,  
Yet steam and light and breath am I.  
Hanging me is useless quite:  
Die? Nay, nay, I cannot die!</pre><hr class="section"></div> </div>
