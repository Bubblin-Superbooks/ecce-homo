<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Of The Poverty Of The Richest</h4><pre class="  ">Ten years passed by—  
Not a drop reached me,  
No rain-fraught wind, no dew of love  
——A rainless land....  
Now entreat I my wisdom  
Not to become stingy in this drought;  
Overflow thyself, trickle thy dew,  
Be thyself the rain of the parched wilderness!  

I once bade the clouds  
Depart from my mountains;  
Once I said to them,  
"More light, ye dark ones!"  
To-day I entice them to come:  
Make me dark with your udders:  
——I would milk you,
