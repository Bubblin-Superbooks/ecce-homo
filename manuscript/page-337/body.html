<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>The Beacon</h4><pre class="  ">Here, where the island grew amid the seas,  
A sacrificial rock high-towering,  
Here under darkling heavens,  
Zarathustra lights his mountain-fires,  
A beacon for ships that have strayed,  
A beacon for them that have an answer!...  

These flames with grey-white belly,  
In cold distances sparkle their desire,  
Stretches its neck towards ever purer heightsâ€”  
A snake upreared in impatience:  
This signal I set up there before me.  
This flame is mine own soul,  
Insatiable for new distances,  
Speeding upward, upward its silent heat.
