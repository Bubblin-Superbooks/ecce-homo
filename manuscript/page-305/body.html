Was not ... But a Philosopher!  
As _that_ you really rate him?  
Set Darwin up by Goethe's side?  
But majesty you thus derideâ€”  
_Genii majestatem_!

What you have builded, yonder inn,  
O'ertops all houses high:  
The posset you have brewed therein  
The world will ne'er drink dry.  
The bird that once appeared on earth
