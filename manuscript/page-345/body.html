<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">O loftiest, star-clustered crown of Being!  
O carved tablets of Eternity!  
And dost thou truly bend thy way to me?  
Thy loveliness, to all—obscurity,  
What? Fear'st not to unveil before _my_ seeing?

O shield of Destiny!  
O carven tablets of Eternity!  
Yea, verily, thou knowest—what mankind doth hate,  
What I alone do love: thou art inviolate  
To strokes of change and time, of fates the fate!  
'Tis only thou, O dire Necessity,  
Canst kindle everlasting love in me!
