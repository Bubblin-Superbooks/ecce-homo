<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">As thou who hangest there!â€”  

O Zarathustra,  
Cruellest Nimrod!  
Of late still a hunter of God,  
A spider's web to capture virtue,  
An arrow of evil!  
Now  
Hunted by thyself,  
Thine own prey  
Caught in the grip of thine own soul.  

Now  
Lonely to me and thee,  
Twofold in thine own knowledge,  
Mid a hundred mirrors  
False to thyself,  
Mid a hundred memories
