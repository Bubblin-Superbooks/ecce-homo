<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Friedrich Nietzsche.</h4><blockquote class="  "><p>On this perfect day, when everything is ripening, and not only the grapes are getting brown, a ray of sunshine has fallen on my life: I looked behind me, I looked before me, and never have I seen so many good things all at once. Not in vain have I buried my four-and-fortieth year to-day; I had the <em>right</em> to bury it—that in it which still had life, has been saved and is immortal. The first book of the <em>Transvaluation of all Values, The Songs of Zarathustra, The Twilight of the Idols,</em> my attempt, to philosophise with the hammer—all these things are the gift of this year, and even of its last quarter. <em>How could I help being thankful to the whole of my life?</em>
That is why I am now going to tell myself the story of my life.</p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
