Come, come, beloved truth!  

——Silence!  
'Tis _my_ truth!  
From timid eyes,  
From velvet shudders,  
Her glance meets mine,  
Sweet and wicked, a maiden's glance.  
She has guessed the reason of my happiness,  
She has guessed me—ha! what is she thinking?  
A purple dragon  
Lurks in the abyss of her maiden's glance.  

——Silence! My truth is speaking!—  

"Woe to thee, Zarathustra!  
Thou lookest like one
