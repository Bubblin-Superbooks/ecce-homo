Hush! I see vastness!—and of vasty things  
Shall man be dumb, unless he can enshrine  
Them with his words? Then take the might which brings  
The heart upon thy tongue, charmed wisdom mine!

O night, mute silence, voiceless cry of stars!  
And lo! A sign! The heaven its verge unbars—  
A shining constellation falls towards me.</pre><hr class="section"><pre class="  ">#### Chapter IV
