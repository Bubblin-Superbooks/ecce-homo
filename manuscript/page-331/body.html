Not much longer thirstest thou,  
O burnt-up heart!  
Promise is in the air,  
From unknown mouths I feel a breath,  
——The great coolness comes....  
My sun stood hot above me at noonday:  
A greeting to you that are coming,  
Ye sudden winds,  
Ye cool spirits of afternoon!  

The air is strange and pure.  
See how the night  
Leers at me with eyes askance,  
Like a seducer!...
