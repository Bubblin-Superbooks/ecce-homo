<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><pre class="no-indent  ">And laughing avalanches, to repel me.  
Around us gnashing pants the lust to kill,  
The torment to win life in all its changes;  
Alluring on some cliff, abrupt and chill,  
Some flower craves the butterfly that ranges.  

All this am I—shuddering I feel it all—  
O butterfly beguiled, O lonely flower,  
The vulture and the ice-pent waterfall,  
The moaning storm—all symbols of thy power,—  
Thou goddess grim before whom deeply bowed,  
With head on knee, my lips with pæans bursting,  
I lift a dreadful song and cry aloud  
For Life, for Life, for Life—forever thirsting!  

O vengeful goddess, be not wroth, I ask,  
That I to mesh thee in my rhymes have striven.  
He trembles who beholds thine awful mask;
